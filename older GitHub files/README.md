# US Bishops and Twitter

In this study, I analyze the Twitter activity of U.S. Roman Catholic bishops. The first stage of building the dataset -- collecting basic information about the bishops, their dioceses, and their Twitter handles -- is complete.

Next steps include:

- Collecting details about the bishops' Twitter accounts:
  - Date of account creation
  - Number of followers
  - Number of accounts followed
  - Number of retweets
  - Number of replies
  - Date of most recent Tweet (as of date of data collection; this information will be most relevant for accounts that are no longer active)
- Gathering information about the counties included in each diocese or archdiocese:
  - Counties included
  - Population
  - Voting patterns in recent elections (presidential and midterms)
- Collecting and analyzing the text of the bishops' Tweets
