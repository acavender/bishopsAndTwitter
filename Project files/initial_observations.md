# Initial observations

In the United States and Virgin Islands, there are 405 bishops.

Of those, 109, or approximately 27%, have Twitter accounts.

Of those 109, two bishops (Richard Stika, formerly of Knoxville, and Andrew Bellisario of Anchorage-Juneau) have accounts that have been suspended, so it isn't possible to see their counts of followers, following, and Tweets. They've been removed from the data set. That leaves 107.

Of those 107:

- 71 have 100 or more Tweets
- 59 have 500 or more Tweets
- 51 have 750 or more Tweets
- 44 have 1,000 or more Tweets
- 36 have 1,500 or more Tweets
- 30 have 2,000 or more Tweets
- 23 have 2,500 or more Tweets
- 19 have 3,000 or more Tweets
- 17 have 3,500 or more Tweets
- 16 have 4,000 or more Tweets
- 15 have 4,500 or more Tweets
- 12 have 5,000 or more Tweets

Three bishops (W. Michael Mulvey of Corpus Christi; Peter L. Smith of Portland, OR; and Robert McElroy of San Diego) have protected accounts. Their Tweets can't be exported for later content analysis, but their followers, following, and Tweets numbers are available.

For the 107 bishops whose Twitter information is available, we have the following basic statistics:

|            | Followers | Following | Tweets |
| ----------:| ---------:| ---------:| ------:|
|   **Mean** |    11,435 |       135 |  2,103 |
| **Median** |     2,053 |        51 |    694 |
|   **Mode** |         7 |         0 |      0 |

The bishop with the most followers (266,458) is Cardinal Dolan of New York.

The bishop following the most other Twitter users (1355) is Bishop Flores of Brownsville.

The bishop with the most Tweets (29,070) is Bishop Talley of Memphis.

(I'd have expected Bishop Robert Barron to have the most followers and the most Tweets. He has 244,029 followers and only 7,588 Tweets.)
