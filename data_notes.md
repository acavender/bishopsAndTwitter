# Data notes

The list of bishops and dioceses in Bishops_and_dioceses_all.xlsx was taken from <https://www.usccb.org/about/bishops-and-dioceses/all-dioceses>. Last accessed: 8 July 2023. The information is correct as of that date.

Information on followers, tweets, following, and cost to download in Twitter_bishops.xlsx taken from <exportdata.io> on 8 July 2023.

Archbishop Andrew Bellisario originally appeared twice. I removed him from the dataset in his capacity as Apostolic Administrator of Fairbanks and kept him as Archbishop of Anchorage-Juneau. (This was done in all spreadsheets: Bishops_and_dioceses_all.xlsx, Bishops_and_dioceses_Roman.xlsx, and Twitter_bishops.xlsx.)

On July 10, 2023, I downloaded county-level election returns from Harvard's Dataverse <dataverse.harvard.edu>: <https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ>.

I don't seem able to match districts to counties in Alaska, so I may want to look only at the lower 48. If I recall correctly, the bishops in Alaska, Hawaii, and the Virgin Islands aren't really engaged on Twitter, anyway.
